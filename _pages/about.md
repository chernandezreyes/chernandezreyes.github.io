I'm a PhD candidate under the supervision of Prof. Daisuke Kurabayashi at the Tokyo Institute of Technology in the [Department of Systems and Control Engineering](https://educ.titech.ac.jp/sc/eng/). 

Research
======

Understanding and replicating olfactory behaviors of insects
------
Despite the spatio-temporal complexity in the dispersion of odorant plumes, insects are excelent at searching and locating sources of chemicals. They conduct such searches in a regular basis to find food or potential mates. This is particularly impressive considering their small amount of neurons. Therefore, it would be useful to model their behavior to implement in robots with limited computational resources. 

Finding a common framework to represent biological and artificial olfactory behavior
------
Research on olfactory behaviors involves two knowledge fields: biology and engineering. The former aims to understand and represent the decision-making of animals and the latter aims to produce effective algorithms for olfactory searches on man-made environments. I investigate how to represent and evaluate both biological and artificial olfactory search agents under the same theoretical framework.
